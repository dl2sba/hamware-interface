# hamware-interface
A small interface board for the HAMWARE controllers AT-502, AT-515 and AT-651. This interface boards supports RS232 and CI-V communications and can be directly mounted into the controller chassis.

It is supported by my alternative HAMWARE firmware https://dl2sba.com/index.php/funk/hamware.
